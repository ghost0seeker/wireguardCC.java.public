Solved: HandleFirewall is not adding required interfaces and ports in server peer
Solved: After starting a connection the program should quit after running "wg"



Before 12-11-2024

Not Reproducable: Monitor mode keeps adding new lines instead of flushing existing

Using present eth0 instead of whatever physical interface is available
    iptables adding double rules for udp listening port
    quiting doesnt remove udp rule from iptables
